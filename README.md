# Prerequisites (do before workshop)

## Installation/ setup steps
(adapted from https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
Bring your laptop! You will write code with it. If you regularly do JavaScript development, you likely have many of these installed on your machine already.

### Install Expo prerequisites
1. [Node.js LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18 or higher)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/). The [Github Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) installs this for you- that's what I use.
3. Recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 
### Download Expo Go (not required, but highly-recommended)
4. Download the "Expo Go" app on your phone from the App Store or Play Store.
### Fork the demo project and restore dependencies
> You can also just clone in case you don't want to push your work to Github

5. Click "Fork" at the top of this page to fork the repo.
6. Clone your fork (easy way: click the green "Code" button, then "Open in Github Desktop").
7. `cd` to the folder and run `npm install`.

## Considerations for specific setups
- Beyond installing tools like Node and Git, you should not need admin access on your machine.
- However, if you run into network, installation, or phone issues, this entire workshop can be done without a phone or simulator. You can run the app in your web browser instead of a phone.

## Platform-specific tips
#### Tips for Windows
- Expo instructions for Windows 11 (PowerShell and WSL-compatible): https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#windows-terminal-support

## Verifying that everything is working
We will walk through this during the workshop, but you can also try it ahead of time to be sure that everything is installed correctly.
(adapted from https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/ - see for troubleshooting tips)
1. In the demo project folder, run `npm install`.
2. Run `npx expo start`.
3. Scan the QR code in the terminal. On iOS, scan the code with the Camera app. On Android, scan the code with the Expo Go app.
4. Alternatively (or in addition to), you can press 'w' to run the app in your browser.
