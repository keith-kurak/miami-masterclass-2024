### Prerequisites?
Not really. This should work if you have a supported Node environment (e.g., 18 or 20). [There's more details about setting up Expo here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).
### Tips for Windows
- Expo instructions for Windows 11 (PowerShell and WSL-compatible): https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#windows-terminal-support
### Still not working?
One helpful thing to try out is to create a blank Expo app and see if it works. Run `npx create-expo-app` and try to run it with the instructions above. If that doesn't work, there's quite likely something up with your local dev environment.
